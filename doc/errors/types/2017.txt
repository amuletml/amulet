This method signature has an ambiguous type, i.e. it doesn't mention
some of the variables bound by the class head.

Class methods have to mention at least a subset of the variables bound
by the class head, with the condition that the subset is enough to
determine all of the other bound variables via functional dependencies.
For example:


    class foo 'a 'b begin
      val x : unit -> 'a
    end

The type of x is ambiguous since it only mentions `'a`, and that's not
enough to determine `'b`.

    class bar 'a 'b | 'a -> 'b begin
      val y : unit -> 'a
    end

Here, the type of y is the same as that of x, but it is not ambiguous
for the class `bar` since knowing the instantiation of `'a` is enough to
figure out the instantiation of `'b`.
