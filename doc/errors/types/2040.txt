Type functions with polymorphic (`forall .` or `forall ->`) headed types
do not play nicely with how the Amulet type checker is implemented
internally. Thus, using these types in practice might be a bit
complicated.

    type function foo ('x : bool) begin
      foo true  = forall 'a. 'a -> 'a
      foo false = ()
    end

    type sbool 'x =
      | STrue  : sbool true
      | SFalse : sbool false

    let
      foo :
        forall 'b. sbool 'b -> foo 'b -> ()
      =
        fun x y ->
          match x with
          | STrue -> y ()
          | SFalse -> y

This program certainly looks reasonable, and one might reasonably expect
it to type-check. But consider what happens when type-checking the
branch

    | STrue -> y ()

The way type checking Amulet proceeds is by building up a set of
constraints by walking over the term, then solving them afterwards, to
support the more complex type system features (like GADTs and type
functions, both of which are at play here).

When amc sees an application like `y ()`, what it does is (roughly) as
following:

1. Assign an unknown type `alpha` for y
2. Since `y` is used in an application, `alpha` must really be equal to
`beta -> gamma` (for some unknown `beta`, `gamma`)
3. The argument to `y` is `()`, so `beta` must be equal to `()`

Solving these constraints, we arrive at the type `() -> gamma` for the
term `y`.

Back to the branch `| STrue -> y ()`, amc will see that `y` is used in a
function position and infer a type like `alpha -> beta` for it, which is
wrong. When generating constraints for the branch, amc doesn't yet know
that `y` has type `forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`; It knows is `y : foo b`
(from the type signature) and that `b ~ true` (from matching on STrue),
but it hasn't quite pieced this information together to arrive at
`y : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`: that's what the solver does!

A possible fix is to "invert" the pattern matching as follows:

    let
      foo :
        forall 'b. sbool 'b -> foo 'b -> ()
      =
        function
          | STrue -> fun (y : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a) -> y ()
          | SFalse -> fun y -> y

Here, the GADT pattern matching scopes over the function expression
`fun (y : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a)`, and we can indeed conclude from
`b ~ true` that `foo b ~ forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`. Thus, `y` enters scope
with a known polymorphic type, and inference can proceed.

The reason that ascribing a type to `y` in the left-hand side doesn't
work is that type ascriptions against polymorphic types will make all
the bound type variables rigid and then check the term against a type
with no quantifiers. For example:

    (fun x -> x) : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a

What happens is that first we _skolemise_ the type
`forall 'a. 'a -> 'a`,
returning a type with a rigid variable instead of `'a` (say `'A`). Then,
we check the function expression against the type `'A -> 'A`.

You can already see why `(y : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a)` won't work: We
skolemise the type to `'A -> 'A` and then try unifying
`forall 'a. 'a -> 'a` (from the expansion of `foo b` with `b ~ true`)
with `'A -> 'A`, which fails.
