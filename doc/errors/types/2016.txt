Amulet does not permit expressions which are not syntatically values to
take on polymorphic types, because that would compromise soundness.
Consider the `let`-binding

    let x = ref None

This would have type `forall 'a. ref (option 'a)`: Trouble.

    x := Some 1 (* use x @int *)
    !x 123      (* use x @(int -> unit) *)

Furthermore, top-level bindings can not have any generalisable variables
in their types, for the same reason (the compiler can't insert a
`forall` to generalise them).
