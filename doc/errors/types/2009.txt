When a type variable is explicitly made polymorphic (with a type
annotation, with an existential variable in a GADT constructor, with
an instance head, or with the LHS of a type function), it becomes
"rigid" and different from all other types (except for itself).

This error happens when the programmer has tried to use some concrete
type in place of a rigid type variable:

    let id : forall 'a. 'a -> 'a =
      fun x -> x + 1
    (*         ^ ^ expects type int *)
    (*         | has type a         *)
