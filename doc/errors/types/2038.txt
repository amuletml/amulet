Amulet is unable to derive an instance for this class. There may be
several reasons for this:

 - The class is not derivable at all. Currently only the `typeable`
   class may be derived.

 - The instance definition is malformed. Deriving instances must take
   the form:

       type foo = Foo
       deriving instance typeable foo
