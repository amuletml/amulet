This error indicates that there was a mismatch between concrete types in
the inferred and expected types for an expression. For example:

    let x : unit = 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4
    (*  ~~~~~~~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  *)
    (*   |            Has type int      *)
    (*  Claims to be type unit          *)

This can also happen when e.g. the elements of a list, or members of a
record, have incompatible types:

    let { x = x : int } = { x = "foo" }
    (*        ~~~~~~~       ~~~~~~~~~                    *)
    (*          |              | Member x is a string    *)
    (*          | Member x is expected to be of type int *)

Type annotations are not the only place where this can crop up:

    let add_1 x = x + 1
    (* val add_1 : int -> int *)
    let _ = add_1 "foo"
    (* Couldn't match actual type string with expected type int *)
