The type checker could not find a value in scope. This is a bug in the
compiler, since badly-scoped programs should be rejected by the resolver
(see E1001).

Please upload your program to a pastebin site and open an issue in the
Amulet repository:

  https://github.com/tmpim/amulet/issues/new?title=TC%20Not%20in%20scope

Try to reduce your program to the smallest possible that still exhibits
the bug.
