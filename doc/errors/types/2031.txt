When a data constructor is used as a type expression, we require that
the type of the constructor be *promotable* to a kind, and furthermore
that the promoted kind be useful.

This means that, currently, constructors that take records as arguments
can't be promoted. Here is what can be promoted:

  * Function types, qualified types and quantified types
    (a -> b, a => b and forall a. b respectively)
  * Tuple types (using the promoted tuple types)
  * All type constructors, and applications thereof
  * Promoted data constructors, and applications thereof
  * Type variables, wildcards
  * The 'int', 'bool' and 'string' types
