This instance declaration violates at least one functional dependency of
the class declaration. For type checking with fundeps to be terminating
it is required that instances satisfy the following condition, called
the "coverage condition":

> For each functional dependency `'tvs_left -> 'tvs_right` of the class,
> every type variable that appears in the types corresponding to
> `tvs_right` must appear in the types corresponding to `tvs_left` in
> the instance head.

Concretely, given the following class:

    class r 'a 'b | 'a -> 'b begin end

The following instances are admissible:

    instance r string string       begin end
    (* no type variables *)

    instance r (list 'a) (list 'a) begin end
    (* 'a appears in both sides *)

    instance r ('a * 'b) 'a        begin end
    (* 'a in the right => 'a in the left *)

But the following are not:

    instance r string 'a    begin end
    (* 'a appears only on the right *)

    instance r 'a ('a * 'b) begin end
    (* 'b appears only on the right *)
