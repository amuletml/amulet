The type for this function is ambiguous, that is, it has variables that
appear in a constraint (i.e. will affect the runtime behaviour of the
function) that can't be determined by unification.

This can happen because:

  * The type variable never appears in the type after it appears in the
    constraint.

  * The type variable only appears as an argument to a type family
    (either an associated type or a type function), in which case it can
    not be determined because type families aren't injective.
