The "hole" in a polymorphic record type can only be instanced with
another record type. For example, this is illegal, because the type
variable `'a` is used in a polymorphic record but is later instantiated
to be an integer.

    let foo : forall 'a. 'a -> { 'a | x : int } -> int =
      fun _ r -> r.x

    foo 123 { x = 1 }
