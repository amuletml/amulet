Amulet does not support equi-recursive, or infinite, types.

This error happens when Amulet is trying to solve an equality constraint
between a type variable and a compound type that mentions that variable.

For example:

  let x = [x] in ()

If we say that 'x : T', for any type 'T', then that must also be the
type of '[x]'. However, the latter has type 'list T', and thus the
equation `T ~ list T` arises. This equation does have a unique solution,
namely the infinite type

  list (list (list (list (list (list (list (list ...)))))))

However, this is generally not what the user wants, even if it would be
easy to support, since infinite types tend to hide genuine programming
errors. If we allowed infinite types, then the following functions would
all type-check, even though they are all buggy:

  let search p = function
    | [] -> error "not found"
    | Cons (x, xs) ->
        if p x then
          x
        else
          search p (* forgot to pass xs *)

  let search' p = function
    | [] -> error "not found"
    | Cons (x, xs) ->
        if p x then
          x
        else
          search (* forgot to pass p and xs *)

  let search'' p = function
    | [] -> error "not found"
    | Cons (x, xs) ->
        if p x then
          x
        else
          p (* returned the predicate instead of searching *)
