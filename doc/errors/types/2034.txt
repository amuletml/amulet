A type synonym (or type function) can't appear with less arguments than
it was declared to have. This is because such an under-saturated
application would correspond to a type-level lambda, and type-level
lambda expressions make type inference undecidable.

#### Possible fix: eta reduction

In the synonym:

    type foo 'a <- list 'a

If you try to use the type `foo` unsaturated (as a synonym for `list`),
the type checker will rightly complain. However, by removing the `'a`
argument in both sides of the equation, `foo` can be used unsaturated:

    type foo <- list
