The type checker encountered a hole (_) expression in the program.
Furthermore, if it can find suitable expressions of the type this hole
was inferred to have, it will print them.

Here, the compiler suggests the following expression as an
implementation for swap, since it is unambiguous.

    fun (x, y) -> (y, x)
