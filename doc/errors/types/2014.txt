This branch of a (GADT) pattern match has unsatisfiable constraints, and
thus can never be executed. Generally, these are equality constraints
arising between indices of the generalised type:

    type vect 'n 'a =
      | Nil : vect Z 'a
      | Cons : 'a * vect 'n a -> vect (S 'n) 'a

    let foo (x : vect Z 'a) =
      match x with
      | Nil    -> () (* This branch is fine; Z ~ Z *)
      | Cons _ -> ()
        (* This branch will never be executed since Cons isn't an
        inhabitant of `vect Z _`, and the type checker can tell you
        since Z ~/~ S _ *)
