Idiom brackets provide a convenient syntax for writing functions
involving applicative computations.

    (| f x y |)

Is equivalent to writing

    f <$> x <*> y

While other application-like expressions can be written in idiom-bracket
notation (such as binary operators), most other expressions do not make
sense in that context, and so are rejected.
