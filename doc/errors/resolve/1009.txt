While `let open` can be used to bring existing modules into scope, it
cannot be used to declare new modules. Instead, lift the module to the
top-level. For instance

    let y =
      let open begin let x = 0 end
      x

Can be safely converted into:


    module M = let x = 0
    let y =
      let open M
      x

Note, there is no theoretical reason for this limitation. However, such
modules may reference locally bound type variables or other names, which
make compilation much harder. This limitation will be lifted in the
future.
