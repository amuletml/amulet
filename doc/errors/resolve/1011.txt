Amulet does not allow two files to import each other.

While it may sound unsavoury, if you find yourself needing to have two
files reference each other, consider refactoring your code so that such
cycles can be eliminated.

Aside from class instances, Amulet does not require that a type's
behaviour is defined in the same file as its definition. Therefore, it's
often possible to reorganise modules to declare types in one file, and
certain behaviours in others.
