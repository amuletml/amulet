The clauses of type functions all need to have the type function being
declared itself as the head of the application. That is, the following
is legal:

    type function f 'a 'b 'c begin
      f 'a 'b 'c = ()
    end

But the following is not:

    type function f 'a 'b 'c begin
      g 'a 'b 'c = ()
    end
