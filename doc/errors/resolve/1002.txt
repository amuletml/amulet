Amulet allows you to declare multiple variables with the same name at
the same time. However, if you try to use such a variable, the compiler
does not know which variable you wanted to use, and so will spit out an
error.

    let x = 0 and x = 1
    x (* Does this mean 0 or 1? *)

The solution is to rename the variables to all be something different.
If you don't need a variable at all, you can replace it with an
underscore (`_`):

    let x = 0 and _ = 1
    x (* x is definitely 0 *)
