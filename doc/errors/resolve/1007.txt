Let bindings within class instances have slightly different behaviour to
let bindings on the top-level of a program. Every binding must declare a
single method and so cannot be composed of a pattern.

Instead of writing the following:

    instance applicative list
      let (pure, (<*>)) = (List.pure, List.( <*> ))

You should write each binding separately:

    instance applicative list
      let pure = List.pure
      let (<*>) = List.( <*> )
