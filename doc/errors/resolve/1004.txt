In Amulet, records cannot have multiple fields with the same name.
Allowing this, would lead to confusing behaviour: which value did you
want to access here:

    let person = { name = "Clara",
                   name = "Clive" }
    person.name (* Clara or Clive? *)

This error most likely occurs due to a field name being misspelled, or
an accidental copy-and-paste resulting in a field being declared
multiple times.
