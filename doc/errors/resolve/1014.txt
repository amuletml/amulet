This target-specific import does not define a path to load for the
current compile target.

For instance, the following definition will work when targetting Lua,
but will fail when compiling to Scheme, as there is no path to import.

    open import { lua = "./other.ml" }

- If your imported module doesn't define any external definitions, this
  can be replaced with a normal import.

- Check you've spelled the compile target correctly in your import
  definition.
