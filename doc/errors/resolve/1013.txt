All clauses of the type function must have as many *visible* arguments
as given in the type function declaration. That is, the following is
legal only when n = k:

    type function f 'a1 ... 'an begin
      f t1 ... tk = ()
    end

For more information, see also the explanation of E2024, which concerns
arity mismatches in associated type definitions.
