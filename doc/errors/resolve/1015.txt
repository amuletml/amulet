This target-specific import defines multiple path to load for the
current compile target.

For instance, if targetting Lua, the following definition says that both
"./a.ml" and "./b.ml" should be imported, which is invalid:

    open import { lua = "./a.ml", lua = "./b.ml" }

This error most likely occurs due to a target name being misspelled, or
an accidental copy-and-paste resulting in a target being declared
multiple times.
