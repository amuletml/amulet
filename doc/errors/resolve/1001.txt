This name cannot be found in the current scope. The most likely cause of
this is that you have misspelled the name you are trying to use.
However, if you would expect this variable to be available, there are
several other things to try:

 1. If the name is something you'd expect to be built in to Amulet, make
    sure you've imported the prelude:

       open import "prelude.ml" (* Needed for `None` *)
       let x = None

 2. If the name is defined in another file or module, make sure you have
    imported and opened the file.

       open import "./my_lib.ml"
       (* ^ Needed in order for `my_function` to be in scope. *)

       let x = my_function ()

3. When writing recursive functions, make sure you have used the `rec`
   modifier:

       (* Without `rec`, you won't be able to use `fib` within its
       definition. *)
       let rec fib = function
       | 0 -> 1
       | 1 -> 1
       | n -> fib (n - 1) * fib (n - 2)
