This error occurs when attempting to bind the same variable multiple
times within a pattern. Such code is confusing, and it is not clear what
behaviour would be expected here.

    function
    | Just x, Just x -> true
    (* `x is declared twice. *)
    | _ -> false

In order to resolve this error, variables should be renamed to ensure
each one is unique.

One interpretation of the above code is that it would check that both
options contain the same value (as they are bound to the same
variable). This behaviour can be emulated with a pattern guard:

    function
    | Just x, Just y when x == y -> true
    | _ -> false
