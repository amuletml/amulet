Amulet heavily relies on indentation in order to determine how a program
should be parsed. As a result, it's a good idea to ensure that your code
is laid out correctly.

Here, the warning is triggered when the `in` separator is not aligned
with the corresponding `let`:

    let x = 0
      in ()

The easiest way to fix this is just to remove the `in` token and adjust
the indentation:

    let x = 0
    ()

The following are also acceptable alternatives:

    let x = 0 in
    ()

    let x = 0
    in ()
