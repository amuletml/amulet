Amulet has syntactic sugar for monadic computations, through the use of
begin/end blocks. In order to bind a monadic value, one should use a
with statement:

    begin
      with x <- f ()
      pure (x + 1)
    end

These statements cannot be used outside of monadic blocks. For instance
the following is invalid:

    let x = with x <- f ()

When using begin/end, make sure that all terms are aligned to the same
column:

    begin
      let y = 2
        with z <- f () (* Incorrect! *)
      pure (x + 1)
    end
