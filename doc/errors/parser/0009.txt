Amulet has sugar for monadic computations, through the use of begin/end
blocks. In order to bind a monadic value, one should use a with
statement:

  begin
    with x <- f ()
    pure (x + 1)
  end

These statements cannot be used outside of monadic blocks. For instance
the following is invalid:

  let x = with x <- f ()

When using begin/end, make sure that all terms are aligned to the same
column:

  begin
    let y = 2
      with z <- f () (* Incorrect! *)
    pure (x + 1)
  end
