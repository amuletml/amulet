A string was opened with a double quote (`"`), but never closed.

1. Amulet strings cannot span multiple lines. If you want to write a
   multi-line string, use `^` to concatenate multiple strings together.

2. You can use a backslash (`\\`) to escape "special" characters within a
   string, such as single or double quotes. Make sure you've not
   accidentally escaped this string's closing quote.
