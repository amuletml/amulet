A string was opened with a double quote ('"'), but never closed.

 • Amulet strings cannot span multiple lines. If you want to write
   a multi-line string, use `^` to concatenate multiple ones together.

 • You can use a backslash ('\') to escape "special" characters within a
   string, such as single or double quotes. Make sure you've not
   accidentally escaped this string's closing quote.
