A comment was opened (using `(*`), but never closed. Add `*)` in order
to end the comment.

 • Note that comments may be nested, meaning that you may need to close
   multiple comments.

 • It is possible to accidentally introduce a comment, especially when
   using operator sections. In these cases, add a space within the
   section's parenthesis.
