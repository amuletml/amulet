Amulet distinguishes between qualified names (those belonging to a
module, such as `Foo.bar`) and unqualified names (those accessed
directly, such as `foo`). While qualified and unqualified names may be
accessed interchangeably, it makes no sense to declare a qualified
name:

  let Foo.x = 1

Instead, one should just write the following:

  let x = 1

The same restriction applies to any declaration, including patterns,
types and constructors.
