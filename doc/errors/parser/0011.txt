Amulet allows you to escape special characters within a string by
prefixing them with a `\`. If you need to write a backslash on its own,
this can be done by escaping the slash using `\\`.

The following escape codes are supported:
 • `\a` - Bell                  (0x07 in ASCII)
 • `\b` - Backspace.            (0x08 in ASCII)
 • `\f` - Form feed page break. (0x0C in ASCII)
 • `\n` - Newline/Line feed.    (0x0A in ASCII)
 • `\r` - Return carriage.      (0x0D in ASCII)
 • `\t` - Horizontal tab.       (0x09 in ASCII)
 • `\v` - Vertical tab.         (0x0B in ASCII)
 • `\"` - Double quote (`"`)    (0x22 in ASCII)
 • `\\` - Backslash (`\`)       (0x5C in ASCII)

 • For any other character, you can use the hexadecimal ASCII value with
   `\x`. For instance, `\x61` represents the character `a`.
