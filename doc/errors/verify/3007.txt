If you have a `match` expression with a single clause, you can rewrite
it as a pattern-matching let expression instead. This reduces
indentation, and should make your code easier to read.

For instance this expression

    match f () with
    | (a, b) -> a + b

may be converted into the simpler

    let (a, b) = f ()
    a + b
