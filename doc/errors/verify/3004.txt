When an expression is expected to have the type of 'lazy', Amulet will
try to convert it to a thunk.

Consider:

    let x = f () || g ()

Here, `( || )` expects the second argument to be lazy. As a result, this
is translated into the following:

    let x = f () || lazy (g ())

However, due to how type inference works, this automatic thunking does
not quite work as expected when in the presence of bindings. Imagine
binding `g ()` to a variable:

    let x = f () || let y = g () in y

This is elaborated into the following:

    let x = f () || (let y = g () in lazy y)

This is clearly not what you would expect, as ideally the whole
expression would be made lazy. In these cases, one should either refactor
the expression into a smaller function, or use `lazy` explicitly.
