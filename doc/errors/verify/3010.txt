Intrinsics are a special kind of foreign declaration which are
understood by the compiler, meaning they can be optimised or used
to generate efficient code.

Intrinsics are declared with a foreign declaration, whose body starts
with '%'. For instance:

    external val ( + ) : int -> int -> int = "%int.add"

If you see this error, this means you are using an intrinsic which
doesn't exist. The compiler will not understand it, and just treat it
as a normal external declaration.

Intrinsics normally have the form "%<type>.<operation>".  Make sure
you've spelled everything correctly, and there's no trailing spaces!
