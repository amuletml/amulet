This definition is not used anywhere within your program. This means the
variable definition can be removed, replaced with a pattern wildcard
(`_`), or entirely removed.

For instance, the binding

    let (x, y) = do_something ()
    y

Can be replaced with:

    let (_, y) = do_something ()
    y

In the cases where no variables are used at all, and the definition has
no side effects, then it may be removed entirely.
