Intrinsics are a special kind of foreign declaration which are
understood by the compiler, meaning they can be optimised or used
to generate efficient code.

Intrinsics are declared with a foreign declaration, whose body starts
with '%'. For instance:

    external val ( + ) : int -> int -> int = "%int.add"

However, when declaring an intrinsic, the types must match up exactly
with what compiler expects. For instance, the integer add operation
shouldn't accept two floats instead!

In order to fix this, it should just be a matter of replacing the
declaration's type with the correct one.
