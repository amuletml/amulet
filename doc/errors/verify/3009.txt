Bindings with type `ref _` at the top-level are global, mutable state
and should generally be avoided. Prefer to give `ref` bindings the
smallest possible scope. For example, instead of writing

    let counter = ref 0
    let next_int () =
      let cur = !counter
      counter := cur + 1
      cur

Write instead:

    let next_int =
      let counter = ref 0
      fun () ->
        let cur = !counter
        counter := cur + 1
        cur
