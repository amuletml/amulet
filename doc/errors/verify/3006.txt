This pattern matching expression does not handle every possible case
that may occur. If such a case does occur, your code will throw an error
and the pogram will most likely crash.

Amulet will inform you which pattern arms are missing. You should just
be able to copy each arm, and add some implementation for it.

Note, if this pattern occurs within a let binding or function, you will
need to replace it with a `match` expression. For instance these
definitions:

    let [x] = xs
    let 2 + 2 = 5

Should be written as:

    let x = match xs with
            | [x] -> x
            | _ -> error "TODO"
    let x + y =
      match x, y with
      | 2, 2 -> 5
      | x, y -> x + y
