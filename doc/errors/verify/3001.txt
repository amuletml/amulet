The right hand side of this recursive definition is invalid. In order to
compute the value of this variable, we'd need to know it's value already.

For instance, consider this definition:

    let rec x = x

Computing x would result in an infinite loop - in order to evaluate x, we
need to evaluate x. This can be avoided by making x lazy, or converting
it into a function:

    let rec x = lazy (force x)

    let rec x () = x ()
