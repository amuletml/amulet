`function` expressions provide a convenient way of writing functions
which split on a single argument. However, if your function only has one
arm to split on, it may be written more easily using `fun`. This makes
your code shorter, and should be easier to understand:

For instance, this expression:

    function
    | (a, b) -> a + b

may be rewritten as the simpler

    fun (a, b) -> a + b
