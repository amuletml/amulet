{- | Helpers for pattern totality checking

This is based on the "GADTs meet their match" paper[1], with some minor
modifications:

 - Amulet is non-lazy, and so pattern evaluation order is not
   defined. Thus we need not consider the "diverging" case in the
   paper. We also merge computation of the covered and uncovered sets
   into one computation.

 - We introduce tuples and record patterns, which are effectively treated
   as single-constructor types (they themselves are always matched, and
   decompose to a single thing).

 - Value abstractions also contain a "literal" and "not literal" case,
   which match against a single literal, and a set of "all literals but
   these".

There are a couple of improvements we could in the future, if needs
arise:

 - We currently do not implement variable+pattern constraints, as we do
   not currently have view patterns.

 - Our handling of guards is rather naive (just discard the uncovered set
   in this case). It is worth considering how we can improve this, while
   still taking into account the lack of purity guarantees.

 - We could optimise the handling of non-GADT destructure patterns so we
   do not need to generate as many free type variables, and can rely less
   on the unifier. The paper[1] discusses some ways of doing this.

 - Improve out handling of uninhabited types. Our checking of
   inhabitedness is rather naive, and just ducks out on recursive types,
   even if they are trivially uninhabited (say, type a = A of a). We
   should also check whether types are inhabited on non-empty arms.
