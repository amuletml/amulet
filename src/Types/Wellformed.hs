   Commentary:

   Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

   FIXME: lmao no kinds. We need them. I removed the broken stuff we
   called "kinds" so I could actually refactor things without GHC
   complaining every 3 nanoseconds, so now the only way to make sure
   types are well formed is through this module. Yay.

   Unfortunately, this is the best I can do right now.


   Checks we peform:
    [1] Polymorphic record types' holes may only be instanced to
    something "row-y", i.e. an exact record, another polymorphic record,
    or a type variable. All other instancings are malformed.
