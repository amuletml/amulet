-- | The "Core.Arity" module acts as a basic system for tracking the
-- arity of various definitions and so the purity of them.
--
-- For instance, consider the following term:
--
-- > \x -> print x
-- >       \y -> x + y
--
-- While the type may have arity 3, the tracker only considers this as
-- arity 2.
--
-- We also disambiguate between impure and pure functions, though
-- analysis of this is currently limited to constructors and
-- builtins. For instance our above function can only be applied to one
-- argument before side effects may occur. Meanwhile, @(+)@ can be
-- applied to 2 without any side effect.
