{- | The allocation sinking pass (also referred to as float-in or lambda
   dropping) moves pure expressions closer to where they are used. If an
   expression is only used within a single branch of a match case, then
   it will be moved into that case.

   This hopefully reduces the times when allocation is needed, as only
   code paths which require the value actually execute it.

   This operates very much as you'd expect: keep track of which variables
   we're trying to sink, determine if they can be sunk to the next level
   and, if not, emit their corresponding bindings here. The main
   exception to this rule is lambdas, as one should not shift values
   /inside/ lambdas: that could lead to duplicating work instead.

   The current purity tracking is rather naive: atoms, constructors and
   records are the only "pure" expressions. It may be a good idea to
   extend this in the future to include partially applied functions (like
   the DCE pass does).
