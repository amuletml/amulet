{- | The dead code pass performs dead code elimination on the
   input core. This pass assumes all pure expressions are dead,
   and will only preserve them if it can find some expression
   which consumes it.

   We consider an expression as pure by using the methods
   provided by "Core.Arity". Thus we must maintain an
   'ArityScope' while traversing the expression tree.

   Each function within the pass returns the optimised
   expression and a set of free variables consumed. If a
   variable is not used, we will remove it (unless the body is
   impure).

   While it may be possible to eliminate unused arguments from
   within this pass, it would probably be more elegant to
   perform this within a lambda lifting pass.
