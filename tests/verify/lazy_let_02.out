lazy_let_02.ml[4:3 ..5:5]: warning (W3004)
  Automatic thunking of lets does not cover bindings

  • Note: the expression
  │ 
5 │   123
  │   ^^^
  will be evaluated lazily, but this binding
  │ 
4 │   let _ = print "foo"
  │       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  is strict.
  • Note: if this is what you want, use lazy explicitly
      to silence this warning.
