fail_skolem_escape.ml[2:19 ..2:37]: error
  Rigid type variable a has escaped its scope of {'a : type}. 'a -> 'o
  路 Note: the variable a was rigidified because of a type ascription
          against the type {'a : type}. 'a -> 'o,
          and is represented by constant au
  
  路 Note: in type `au`
  路 Note: in the inferred type for escape_fail
  
  路 Arising from use of the expression escapes (fun x -> x)
