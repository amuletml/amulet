  Rigid type variable a has escaped its scope of {'a : type}. 'a -> 'o
  • Note: the variable a was rigidified because of a type ascription
          against the type {'a : type}. 'a -> 'o,
          and is represented by constant aw

  • Note: in type `aw`
  • Note: in the inferred type for escape_fail
