gadt04-fail.ml[2:5 ..2:26]: error
  The type `int * int -> t` is malformed.
  • Note: The type int * int -> t
            is not an instance of the type being declared
  • Note: It must end in a reference to t
            but it ends in a tuple
  • Suggestion: did you mean a function, like
                  int -> int -> t?
