2 │   | MkT : int * (int -> t)
  │     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  The type `int * int -> t` is malformed.
  • Note: The type int * int -> t
      is not an instance of the type being declared
  • Note: It must end in a reference to t
      but it ends in a tuple
  • Suggestion: did you mean a function, like
                  int -> int -> t?
