gadt02.ml[7:5 ..7:26]: error
  The type `t2 int -> t2 bool` is malformed.
  • Note: The type t2 bool
            is not an instance of the type being declared
  • Note: It must end in an application like t1 'a
            but it ends in an application of some other type
  • Suggestion: did you mean t1 bool
                instead of t2 bool?
