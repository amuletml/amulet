  Could not match rigid type variable b with the rigid type variable a
  • Note: the variable b was rigidified because of the context, the type
          forall 'a 'b. term unit ('a -> 'b -> 'b)
          and is represented by the constant pn

  • Note: the rigid type variable a, in turn,
          was rigidified because of the context, the type
          forall 'a 'b. term unit ('a -> 'b -> 'b)
