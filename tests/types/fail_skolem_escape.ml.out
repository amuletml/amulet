fail_skolem_escape.ml[2:19 ..2:37]: error
  Rigid type variable a#4 has escaped its scope of {'a#4 : type}. 'a#4 -> 'o#45
  路 Note: the variable a#4 was rigidified because of a type ascription
          against the type {'a#4 : type}. 'a#4 -> 'o#45,
          and is represented by constant au#46
  
  路 Note: in type `au#46`
  路 Note: in the inferred type for escape_fail#5
  
  路 Arising from use of the expression escapes#1 (fun x#6 -> x#6)
