overflow-fail.ml[22:14 ..22:33]: error
  Could not choose implicit value of type add 'a 'k 'c
  Choosing a candidate took over 200 iterations.
  • Suggestion: bind the choice with an implicit function.

  • Possible cause: ambiguous type variables 'k, 'a, 'c prevent choosing a value.
       Perhaps add a type annotation, specifying the wanted type?
